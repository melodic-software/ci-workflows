// check-key-credit: whether a keyed lane's key job should skip the model
// because the key ended in a credit stop inside the window.
//
// The key job uploads an artifact named markerName(workflow, keyJob) after
// the launcher's lane-class `credit-stop` (run-claude-cli: classify.cjs
// isCreditStop), so an auth stop (401, or 402 without the credit text) never
// writes one. This gate's first call reads the repository's artifacts of that
// exact name, and skips the key when the newest unexpired one was created
// inside the window, citing the run that uploaded it. The window counts from
// that upload, so a topped-up or rotated key is tried on the first run after
// it (the window backs off: see below). No marker in the window, any failure
// or an unreadable answer runs the key, as before this gate: it never skips
// the subscription path and never fails the step.
//
// The name carries the caller workflow's file and the key job, so each
// caller's key is judged on its own credit stops. A fork's pull_request run
// holds no secret but can upload an artifact of any name from a modified
// workflow, so a marker counts only when its run's head repository is this
// repository (workflow_run.head_repository_id equal to repository_id), as
// the run-history read's exclude_pull_requests did. Any workflow of this
// repository can still upload one; the worst it does is move reviews to the
// subscription for the window. More than 100 markers of one name in
// retention can push the newest off the page, which runs the key or shortens
// the step.
//
// The probing marker closes the re-probe race: when the window has ended but
// a credit-stop marker is still in retention, every gate until the first
// re-probe's own credit stop lands would run the empty key. So the gate then
// makes a second call, the probing markers (probeName), and:
//   - a probing marker created after that credit stop and inside the probe
//     window skips, citing the probing run;
//   - one created after it but older than the probe window means that probe
//     hit no credit stop, so the key runs and no new probe is written;
//   - none means this gate is the probe: the key runs and the probing-marker
//     output names the artifact the gate job uploads.
// With no credit-stop marker in retention the key is healthy: one call, no
// probe, so a working key is never held to one call per probe window. A
// failed probe read runs the key and writes no probe. A probe run cancelled
// before its key leg leaves no credit stop either, so the next gate after it
// expires runs the key as healthy.
//
// The window backs off: window-hours is the base step, and each consecutive
// credit stop doubles it, capped at 24 hours (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 from a base
// of 1; a base above 24 hours never backs off). Consecutive credit stops are
// the credit-stop markers created after reset-at, oldest first, where:
//   - a marker counts as the next step only when it was created at or after
//     the previous counted marker plus that marker's window, so it came from
//     a run let through to try the key again; markers inside a window, from
//     runs already in flight when the key stopped, add no step;
//   - a probing marker between two markers that no credit-stop marker
//     followed inside the probe window is a key run that worked, and the
//     next marker starts again at the base step.
// The step comes from the two listings the gate already reads, with no new
// call: inside the base window any step skips, so only a credit stop past it
// needs the step, and that path already reads the probing markers. Both
// markers are kept 7 days, long enough for six steps at the cap; a marker
// that expires only shortens the step. reset-at, the time the rotation tool
// last pushed a key (vars.KEY_CREDIT_RESET_AT), drops every credit stop
// before it, so a new key is tried on the next run. Empty or anything but an
// ISO-8601 UTC time is no reset. A key whose credit comes back on its
// account's monthly cycle, or one set by hand with `gh secret set`, writes no
// reset-at, so it waits out the current step, at most 24 hours; action.yml
// gives the one-line manual reset.
